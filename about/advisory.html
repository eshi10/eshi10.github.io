        <p>Bob Waterston, MD, PhD, is a Professor of Genome Sciences and Medical Genetics at University of Washington
          where he was the Department Chair of Genome Sciences from 2002 to 2019. His research includes working with the
          Sanger Institute to complete the first genomic sequence of C. elegans. These efforts were followed by his work
          on the Human Genome Project, which was completed in April 2003. At UW, Dr. Waterston’s work has centered
          around research and education in genetics, genomics, proteomics and computational biology. His primary
          laboratory focuses on the exploring ways to contribute to the understanding of human and the nematode worm, C.
          elegans, genomes.</p>
